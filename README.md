## About The Project

The **ML Movies Recommender System** is a machine learning-based application that recommends movies based on user input. By utilizing the power of cosine similarity and content-based filtering, the system suggests movies similar to the one the user selects. This project includes a user interface built using **Streamlit**, which allows users to interact with the recommender system and see the results displayed in a visually appealing format, including movie posters.

### Dataset

The system is powered by the **tmdb_5000_movies.csv** dataset, which is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:  
[TMDB Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv).  
This dataset contains metadata for 5000 movies, including details such as genres, tags, keywords, and more.

## Key Features

1. **Movie Recommendations:**
   - Suggests movies based on the similarity of movie content (such as genres, tags, and keywords).

2. **Movie Posters:**
   - Displays movie posters for the recommended films.

3. **Interactive UI:**
   - Users can input a movie title and receive movie recommendations.

4. **Efficient Recommender:**
   - Built using content-based filtering and cosine similarity to generate recommendations.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Model Persistence:** Joblib (for saving and loading models)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas
- **Web Requests:** Requests (for fetching movie posters)
- **Deployment:** Heroku/Streamlit Cloud

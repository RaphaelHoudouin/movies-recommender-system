## About The Project

The **Movies Recommender System** is a machine learning-based application that recommends movies based on user input. By utilizing the power of cosine similarity and content-based filtering, the system suggests movies similar to the one the user selects. This project includes a user interface built using **Streamlit**, which allows users to interact with the recommender system and see the results displayed in a visually appealing format, including movie posters.

The project features a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**, enabling users to:  
- Interact with the recommender system.  
- Input a movie title to receive recommendations.  
- View results, including visually appealing movie posters.

### Dataset

The system utilizes the TMDB5000 dataset to fetch metadata and details for movies, including information such as genres, tags, keywords, and more, enabling accurate and personalized recommendations.
